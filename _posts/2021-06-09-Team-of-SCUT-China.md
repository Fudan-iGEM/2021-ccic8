地处潮湿多雨的南方，驱蚊问题一直备受广州人民的关注。蚊子不仅让人心烦意乱，更可怕的是，蚊子还会传播各种疾病，如登革热等对人类的健康造成极大威胁。因此在热带和亚热带地区，驱蚊产品有着很大的市场需求。圆柚酮是 EPA报道的新型驱蚊成分，具有更高的安全性和稳定性，但高昂的成本造成了生产限制。我们通过酿酒酵母的启动子工程实现圆柚酮前体(瓦伦烯)的高产量。我们首先建立酿酒酵母启动子库，并通过不同启动子的上游激活序列(UAS)的组合，获得了发酵早期和晚期均支持高表达的杂合启动子。接着我们建立核小体亲和力模型，对启动子进行优化，使转录效率最大化，从而提高诺卡酮前体(瓦伦烯)的生产量，最终使圆柚酮获得更高的市场份额，降低生产成本，让更多人受益。

Located in the humid and rainy south, the problem of mosquito repellent has been the concern of Guangzhou people. Mosquitoes are not only annoying, but what's more, they can also spread various diseases, such as dengue fever, which is a great threat to human health. So, in tropical and subtropical areas, mosquito repellant products are in great demand. Nootkatone is a new mosquito repellent ingredient reported by EPA, which offers increased safety and stability, but high cost has caused production limitations. We plan to achieve high yield of nootkatone precursor (valencene) through promoter engineering. Firstly, we establish a promoter pool of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Then, we obtain stronger promoters that support high expression to synthesize valencene for most fermentation phases via alternation and recombination of upstream activated sequence (UAS). We establishe nucleosome affinity model to optimize the UAS of the hybrid promoter, so as to maximize the efficiency of the transcription, which ultimately helps achieve higher market shares of nootkatone, reduce production costs and let more people benefit from it.

Currently, the world is still faced with the COVID-19 epidemic caused by novel coronavirus which urgently requires flexible and targeted protection measures. Novel coronavirus belongs to the family of forward RNA viruses. The spike proteins on its surface bind to the human cell surface receptors called ACE2 and then enter the cell through endocytosis. Reducing the expression of ACE2 does not cause significant structural abnormalities. Therefore, recognizing and inhibiting the expression level of ACE2 is considered to be an effective treatment for COVID-19. CRISPR-Cas13d is an RNA-guided ribonuclease which targets ssRNA. The RNA-targeted ribonuclease activity of Cas13d is independent of the specific adjacent sequences, which meets the requirements of rapid development of gRNA.

SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects the human respiratory and digestive systems. It causes disease through direct cytotoxic effects and inducing inflammatory response. We select human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T), lung cells (HLF-a), colorectal cells (CCD-18Co) and gastric cells (GES-1) to establish hACE2 stable transfection lines respectively and lentivirus with novel coronavirus spike protein is used as pseudovirus. Through bioinformatics screening of crRNA pool for ACE2 conserved sequence, the lentivirus /CRISPR-Cas13d system was constructed. Specific crRNA-mediated Cas13d system is used to target and knock down the mRNA level of ACE2 in four stable cell lines, which leads to a decrease in the expression of the receptor protein ACE2 on the cell surface. Thus, entry of the pseudovirus into cells was inhibited. We will use vitro and cell experiments to verify the effect of CRISPR-Cas13d system designed by us.

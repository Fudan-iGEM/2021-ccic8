### A Manufacturing Project

Every year, about 14,000 tons of sunscreen are deposited into the ocean, producing a large amount of chemical pollution, especially oxybenzone and octyl-methoxycinnamate. This has greatly worsened the phenomenon of coral bleaching.

To alleviate the current situation, we are developing an environmentally-friendly bio-sunscreen that is harmless to coral reefs and the marine ecosystem. Inspired by how animals and plants in nature protect themselves from UV rays, we have decided to produce gadusol, a natural UV filter originated from zebrafish, as the main component of our bio-sunscreen product. We will introduce the synthetic pathways of gadusol into *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and engineer it into a cell factory to balance the use of sunscreen and the protection of coral reefs.

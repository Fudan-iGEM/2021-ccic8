### A New Application Project

CEPI (Confederation of European Paper Industries) has reported that the recycling rate of office waste paper (OWP) is dramatically low (12.9%) in Europe though this kind of paper has a high value to regenerate. In addition, our market research has produced similar results. We find that cellulase, xylanase, lipase, and laccase will allow biodeinking to occur, by helping the ink detach from the waste paper and decomposing hazardous substances. In our project, we designed a new surface assembly of a functional cellulosome by using a synthetic yeast consortium, Pichia pastoris. The basic design of the consortiums consisted of five different engineered yeast strains are capable of displaying a trifunctional scaffolding carrying two divergent cohesion domains from Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium cellulolyticum in proportion 2:1, secreting the two corresponding dockerin-tagged cellulase and xylanase and the other two enzymes named lipase and laccase. The secreted cellulase and xylanase are docked onto the displayed Scaffolding in a highly organized manner based on the specific interaction of the two cohesin-dockerin pairs, resulting in the assembly of a functional cellulosome on the yeast surface. To bring our idea to the real world, we design a paper recycle machine (Deinker), mainly including the transmission part, the enzyme liquid smearing part, the deinking part, and the paper drying part. When using, the paper only needs to be fixed on the cardboard, and the deinking can be started with one button on the touch screen. Finally, you can get a piece of white paper that can be used again. Through this device, the office waste paper will be reborn. In addition, mathematical models are built for improving experiments, hardware, and implementation: A model for specific protein structure prediction and molecular docking; a model for predicting the optimum ratio and reaction conditions of various enzymes; a model for ink recognition on the paper surface; a model for improving the drying efficiency of paper by increasing the performance of the machine; a decision-making model of optimal placement of deinker in different application scenarios. Prospectively, our research project can not only recycle office paper but also reduce the cost of printing errors and prevent the leakage of information. Deink the dark make the world better with less tree cut.

### A High-School Environment Project

The next decade is a pivotal period in tackling climate change. To achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement and restrict the temperature rise within 1.5°C, the annual carbon reduction rate by 2030 should reach 11.7%, which is fivefold the current rate. To achieve these goals, the world's energy mix requires a rapid transition to renewable and low-carbon energy. Low-carbon hydrogen can be used as a powerful substitute for hydrocarbons, according to the International Energy Agency, the predicted global demand for hydrogen will increase sevenfold to 520 million tons from 2019 to 2070.

Compared with traditional methods, biohydrogen production has more advantages in terms of cost and environmental benefits. As low-cost clean energy, biohydrogen shares extensive market prospects. SJTang hopes that by optimizing the hydrogen production metabolic pathways and cultivation approaches of E. coli and R.palustris, the efficiency of biological hydrogen production can be further improved, and thereby reducing unit costs. In the meantime, we plan to calculate the greenhouse gas emission of cellular activities, develop quantitative hardware, and establish operating procedures and best practice guidelines for greenhouse gas tracking in the production cycle. Combining production optimization and quantitative carbon tracking, SJTang will strive to achieve full-cycle carbon neutrality of biohydrogen production.

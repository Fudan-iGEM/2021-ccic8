### A New Application Project

Tyrian purple, also known as, 6,6-dibromoindigo, is a kind of natural pigment with a long history of production and application, which was always been preferred by the royal. In addition to its value in history and culture, as a kind of novel biocompatible semiconductor it also receive much attention. However, due to natural yield little, difficulty in chemosynthesis and the potential pollution, its high yield production hasn’t been realized. Therefore, we plan to implement a two-cell reaction by spatiotemporally separating the two consecutive procedures of the production, so that the enzyme in tyrian purple metabolic pathway could achieve its highest efficiency. Moreover, we can choose some gene expression regulatory parts to improve the high-yield and high-purity dual cell system.

帝王紫，即6，6-二溴靛蓝，是拥有悠久生产与应用历史的天然染料，历史上一直为统治阶级所钟爱，除其承载的历史文化价值外，帝王紫作为新型生物相容性导体，在半导体材料中也倍受瞩目。但由于其天然产量少，化学合成困难且存在环境污染，迄今未能实现高产。本项目拟采用双细胞系统，进行生产时空分离，以达到帝王紫代谢通路中相关酶的最高利用效率，并严格筛选基因表达调控原件，构建帝王紫高纯度，高产量双细胞体系。

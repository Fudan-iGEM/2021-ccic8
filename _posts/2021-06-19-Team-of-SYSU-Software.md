It is not uncommon in bio-factories and laboratorie that people need to regulate the behavior of target organisms again and again. It is an difficult task. So, we build Phoebus. The core module of Phoebus is an opto-controllable element designer, which guide users to choose appropriate opto-switches and linker to rebuild target protein into opto-controllable element, predict the structure of the fusion protein and evaluate its acticity. User still need specific plugins for specific situations, and we will provide two plugins as examples: (1) opto-controllable enzyme oligomerization for light control of cascade reactions, and (2) opto-controllable transcription, for light control of transcription rate.

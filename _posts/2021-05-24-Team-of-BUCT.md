Humans have been plagued by obesity and anxiety for a long period of time. Studies have shown that obesity can aggravate anxiety while depression and anxiety also fuel obesity, namely the depression-obesity circle. In order to break this circle and alleviate people's body shame and anxiety, we used *E. coli* Nissle 1917 as a chassis with enhanced capacity of β-oxidation of fatty acid thereby increasing fatty acids consumption from diets to facilitate weight loss. Meanwhile, GABA and 5-HTP with anxiety-relieving effects were synthesized from the catabolic products of fatty acids and glycerol in our engineered bacteria. To sum up, this project aims to ameliorate obesity and anxiety simultaneously by converting fatty acids, which causes body shame, to GABA and 5-HTP, ultimately breaking the depression-obesity circle.

长期以来，人们备受肥胖和焦虑的困扰。研究表明，肥胖和焦虑之间存在着双向影响，即“depression-obesity circle”。为缓解这种循环带来的“body shame”以及焦虑等烦恼，我们利用 *E. coli* Nissle 1917 底盘，通过加强它对人们日常饮食中的脂肪酸的β氧化反应帮助人们减肥。同时采用合成生物学思想，利用工程菌分解脂肪的前体物质合成具有缓解焦虑效果的GABA和5-HTP。

### A Therapeutics Project

In recent years, the success of CAR-T, CAR-NK and other therapies in the field of tumor therapy has fully demonstrated the potential of cellular immunotherapy. Macrophages are one of the most important natural immune cells to resist viral infection. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) reprogrammed macrophages may be able to engulf SARS-CoV-2 virus and be used to treat COVID-19. Since the activation of traditional CAR may lead to inflammatory cytokine storms, we attempt to construct a CAR-macrophage capable of engulfing viral particles without upregulating cytokine levels. 

Methods: 1. Construction of CAR-macrophages: CAR consists of single chain antibody scFV against S protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus, CD8 transmembrane domain and intracellular domain. We focus on the transformation of the CAR intracellular domain and design four different CARs: CARγ, CARMEGF10, CARMERTK, and CARζ. CAR-macrophages are obtained by transfecting human macrophage line THP-1 with lentivirus. 2. Function and safety assessment of CAR-macrophages: 1) Scavenging effect of CAR-macrophages on SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral particles; 2) Assessing the secretion level of inflammatory factors in CAR-macrophages; 3) Testing the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 to CAR-macrophages; 4) Verifying the protective effect of CAR-macrophages on Vero E6 cell line infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Experimental results: Results show that programmed CAR-macrophages were successfully constructed and characterized, and its function was initially verified in vitro. 1. CAR-macrophages can engulf SARS-CoV-2 virus particles; 2. CARMERTK-macrophages did not upregulate cytokine levels; 3. CAR-macrophages were not infected by SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: We successfully used CARs to induce the targeting of macrophages on spikes on the surface of pseudoviral particles. Compared with CAR-T therapy, macrophages were used as the chassis to give full play to the important role of macrophages in viral immunity. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines is not up-regulated in the process of phagocytosis of pseudovirions by CARMERTK-macrophages, which has high safety.

Long and costly process lies between target discovery and drug approval. So, in recent decade, pharmaceutical corporations have been using distributed AI models to assist in accelerating the R & D cycle and reducing costs in multiple stages, yet the average cost is still increasing. For peptide drugs, that multiple stages come as follows: data collection, feature representation, AI model construction, rational design, peptide library construction, affinity prediction, animal model experimental test, clinical test and the last approval. By developing a general and integrated AI model of peptide directed evolution, we can generate an optimized peptide virtual library from the target protein in one step instead, only to be waited for the next animal model experiment. Based on the idea of generation antagonism networks (GAN) , we developed and combined multi-dimensional discriminant networks and a sequence generation network to compete with each other, quickly and finely generate multiple optimal solutions in the protein sequence space under the constraints of given targets and expected multi properties, as new potential peptide drugs, to achieve the goal of one-step generation of the most promising sequence library.

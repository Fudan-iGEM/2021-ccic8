Antibiotics, which served as an agent that can kill the bacteria effectively, plays a crucial role in treating and preventing bacterial infection. However, it was abused in many fields, especially animal husbandry. Over the recent years, the use of antibiotics has caused heated debate and controversy. Meanwhile, the degradation efficiency of antibiotics has not kept pace with their wide range of animal hunsbandry applications. Scientists hypothesized that the consumption of antibiotics in edible animal will surge from 23% in 2010 to 30% in 2030. The harm of adding antibiotics in feed is mainly reflected in two aspects: the accumulation in poultries, and the increasing in the resistance of bacteria, which may lead to the form of super-bacteria that could be detrimental to both environment and living beings. 

While, Conventional methods like high temperature composting, fermentation and microbial degradation have some potential problems including low efficiency and high costs. Effective new methods are urgently needed. 

Fortunately, the Whole Cell Biocatalyst Ecn-IL, can be a favorable solution to the mentioned issue. With the technology of cell surface display, the Laccase gene (lacc6) which originated from Pleurotus ostreatus can be displayed on the surface of Probiotic *E. coli*, Nissle 1917 (EcN), and form a membrane-like mechanism to decompose the antibiotics residues. The utilization of the Ecn-Il can effectively avoid the accumulation of the antibiotics in animals. Besides, without the mountainous usages of antibiotics, the tolerability can be largely reduced, and thus the formation of the super-bacteria can also be avoided. More importantly, the Ecn-IL is friendly to the environment. Specifically, when using the Ecn-IL, people can save much resources and eliminate the residual of the antibiotics that lie in the waste-water, soil, and animals’ excrement at the same time.

We are the 2021 iGEM team,Magic Blue. As shown by our name,we hope to get a kind of healthy blue pigment—phycocyanin,letting more people have the taste of blue. Using yeast as the carrier, it’s safe and convenient to access to food. The brief process is that we insert two modified plasmids into it, finally generates phycocyanin in the cytosol, making the yeast appear blue.

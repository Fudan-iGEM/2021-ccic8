### A High-School Environment Project

Gums stick on everywhere, damaging city scape, consuming huge material resources.
In a word, we aim to let the "sticky" gums on the ground disappear from the planet！
From eliminating aspect, we will design a liquid gum cleaner with  enzyme to clean up the gums.
From preventing aspect, we will design a self-degrading gum.
From these aspects, our project will improve city environment and reduce cleaning cost. We are excited to contribute to the world's sustainable development.

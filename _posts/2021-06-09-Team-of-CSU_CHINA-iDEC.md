### An Information Processing Project

Over the years, we have suffered from different kinds of corona-viruses, such as MERS, SARS-CoV-2 and so on. At present, the detection methods of these viruses are becoming mature, but prediction or detection systems for multiple corona-viruses is uncommon.  
Our project intends to construct an engineering bacteria to detect MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2 at the same time. First, we used PmrCAB system to detect corona-virus protein. Then we used the  quorum sensing system based on *LuxI / LuxR* in *E. coli* and added HRP amplifier in order to amplify the signal. Finally, these three kinds of engineering bacteria are put in the same device to realize the multi virus detection in  environment.

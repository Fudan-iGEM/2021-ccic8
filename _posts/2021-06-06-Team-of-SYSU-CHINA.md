### A Foundational Advance Project

Team SYSU-CHINA this year plans to use Rational-designed circRNA scaffold to handle some practical problems, such as improving the production of biofuel. We choose different RNA binding proteins fused with different proteins of interest by different kinds of linkers, which can bind to specific sites on the circRNA constructed in vitro. After debugging, we hope to colocalize a series of related enzymes and accelerate the biochemistry reaction.

### A Therapeutics Project

Acne is a common skin disease. Generally speaking, acne is related to pores being blocked by sebum and propionibacterium acnes proliferating in such an anaerobic environment. Our project aims at acne caused by such factors and hopes to develop a drug for acne treatment with less side effects and convenience. On the one hand, our engineering bacteria have stronger ability to break down fatty acids, unblocking the pores, which will destroy the anaerobic environment. On the other hand, our engineering bacteria can secrete bacteriocin which is able to kill propionibacterium acnes. At the same time, in order to ensure the precise synthesis and secretion of killing substances, we added fatty acid-sensitive promoters before bacteriocin. We hope to further optimize the function of the promoters by means of directed evolution. In terms of safety, we will prevent environmental pollution or other safety threats by using nutritionally deficient engineered bacteria.

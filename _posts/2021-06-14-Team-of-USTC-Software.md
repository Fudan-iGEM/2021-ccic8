### A Software Project

Nowadays, machine learning has been devoted to various areas, and has made some magnificent contribution in Synthetic biology, for example, Alphafold2 by Google, which can accurately predict the 3D structure by protein sequence, and some other models predicting the properties of protein sequence. But recently there is still lack of tools that is user-friendly and can integrate existing model and software. Thus, CAT, Convenient Accurate Tool, is designed. Based on the purpose of offering an highly-efficient software to our user, we collect some important properties of protein sequence. Moreover, we combine CAT with education and build up a education version in order to briefly introduce the models and the achievement that machine learning has done in synthetic biology. By the education version, we hope that CAT can motivate students’ interest and make further contribution in the area of synthetic biology and machine learning.

如今机器学习在各个领域都有着显著的成果，并且在合成生物学领域也做出了极大的贡献，例如能精准预测蛋白质三级结构的Alphafold2。但是现在还缺乏一个用户友好且将这些模型整合在一起的工具，CAT由此诞生了，我们集结一些重要的属性预测，使用户能高效的得到想要的结果，并且结合教育，搭建一个教育版，介绍所用模型以及应用在合成生物学中的成果。

### A New Application Project

Nuclear power is an important source in electricity production, and it always needs to be built on coast for its huge requirement of cooling water. However, marine organisms such as *Phaeocystis globosa* and *Mytilus eduli* sometimes cause blockage, resulting in the low efficiency of the water cooling system. There are few means available to solve these problems currently.

Here, we show our inspiration that the Lectin-SpyTag/SpyCatcher can pull down *P. globosa* colonies and then the HutH-fused proteins suppress the activity of *P. globosa*. To inhibit *M. eduli* fouling, *Vibrio natriegens* are engineered to express LCIKR2, which functions to attach engineered bacteria to the appendicular plastic cover on the coarse grille. What’s more, engineered bacteria which express 3NM8 and TnaA are used to inhibit *M. eduli* attachment on the coarse grille. Genes *rhlA* and *rhlB* are also introduced, which are necessary for bioproduction of rhamnolipids, a surfactant that can remove protection of mussel foot protein (mfp). As for biosafety, a blue-light-activated device, pDawn, is implemented to control the expression of toxic protein BlrA, which can constrain the engineered bacteria in a reservoir with two blue light strips upstream and downstream.

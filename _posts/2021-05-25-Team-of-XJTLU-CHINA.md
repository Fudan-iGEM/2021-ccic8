### A Diagnostics Project

Our project is to use edited phages containing specific protein-coding genes to infect and lyse bacteria and release the transfected exogenous protein “luxR”, which can then activate downstream cell-free gene circuit and generate visual signal. At that time, the edited phage will not be assembled as the gene of related key protein is cleaved. The downstream circuit outputs binary signals indicating the bacteria concentration meets the national standard or not.

### An Environment Project

Since the implementation of household garbage sorting regulations in Shanghai, the amount of food waste has reached a peak. However, the health problems and unpleasant smell caused by odor generated from food waste have aroused attention not only in Shanghai but also in other areas. This year, Tongji China launches the "LOOK！" project to solve the odor of food waste. We construct two kinds of bioengineered E. coli to absorb hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, which are the two main ingredients in the odor. One uses enzymes related to sulfide oxidazation(Sqr, Sdo, AprBA and Sat), converting hydrogen sulfide to sulfate, while the other uses enzymes related to ammonia oxidazation (AMO, HAO and NOD), converting ammonia to nitrate. Besides, a three-gear adjustable kill switch based on the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>S and NH<sub>3</sub> will be added to ensure biosafety. Also, we'll optimize our pathway by high throughput screening and machine learning. We've conducted several rounds of Human Practices to gather suggestions from various aspects to improve our project. With such efforts, we hope that the problems the odor has brought to residents as well as waste disposal industries and their downstream industries can be solved in the future.

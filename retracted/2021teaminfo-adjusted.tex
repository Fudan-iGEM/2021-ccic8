Humans have been plagued by obesity and anxiety for a long period of time. Studies have shown that obesity can aggravate anxiety while depression and anxiety also fuel obesity, namely the depression-obesity circle. In order to break this circle and alleviate people’s body shame and anxiety, we used E. coli Nissle 1917 as a chassis with enhanced capacity of β-oxidation of fatty acid thereby increasing fatty acids consumption from diets to facilitate weight loss. Meanwhile, GABA and 5-HTP with anxiety-relieving effects were synthesized from the catabolic products of fatty acids and glycerol in our engineered bacteria. To sum up, this project aims to ameliorate obesity and anxiety simultaneously by converting fatty acids, which causes body shame, to GABA and 5-HTP, ultimately breaking the depression-obesity circle.

长期以来，人们备受肥胖和焦虑的困扰。研究表明，肥胖和焦虑之间存在着双向影响，即“depression-obesity circle”。为缓解这种循环带来的“body shame”以及焦虑等烦恼，我们利用 E. coli Nissle 1917 底盘，通过加强它对人们日常饮食中的脂肪酸的β氧化反应帮助人们减肥。同时采用合成生物学思想，利用工程菌分解脂肪的前体物质合成具有缓解焦虑效果的GABA和5-HTP。\end{spacing}

Over the years, humans have suffered from coronavirus several times, and today we still troubled by SARS-CoV-2. It’s unknown whether we will be affected by the coronavirus in the future. Detection of environmental coronavirus would be a critical step for cutting off the source and route of its infection. Therefore, it is necessary to design a multivirus detector to help solve epidemic caused by coronavirus. In this study, we developed an environmental multivirus detection device based on engineered E. coli to capture coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, to spark fluorescence reporter gene. The PmrCAB system derived from Salmonella was recombined onto the surface of E. coli, and the Fe(III) recognition site of PmrB was replaced with the receptor of targeted coronavirus. Therefore, the bacteria can capture coronavirus via binding to their receptors and transport signaling to the downstream components. LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing system from E. coli and Hrp amplifier from Pseudomonas syringae were used to enhance the sensitivity and output signal. In addition, we also develop an improved air sampler to enrich nanoparticle in air onto engineered E. coli. The implementation of the environmental multivirus detection would be helpful for establish a preventive system in public place, such as hospital and super market.\end{spacing}

\textbf{\\A Therapeutics Project\\}\begin{spacing}{1.5}

In recent years, the success of CAR-T, CAR-NK and other therapies in the field of tumor therapy has fully demonstrated the potential of cellular immunotherapy. Macrophages are one of the most important natural immune cells to resist viral infection. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) reprogrammed macrophages may be able to engulf SARS-CoV-2 virus and be used to treat COVID-19. Since the activation of traditional CAR may lead to inflammatory cytokine storms, we attempt to construct a CAR-macrophage capable of engulfing viral particles without upregulating cytokine levels.

Methods: 1. Construction of CAR-macrophages: CAR consists of single chain antibody scFV against S protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus, CD8 transmembrane domain and intracellular domain. We focus on the transformation of the CAR intracellular domain and design four different CARs: CARγ, CARMEGF10, CARMERTK, and CARζ. CAR-macrophages are obtained by transfecting human macrophage line THP-1 with lentivirus. 2. Function and safety assessment of CAR-macrophages: 1) Scavenging effect of CAR-macrophages on SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral particles; 2) Assessing the secretion level of inflammatory factors in CAR-macrophages; 3) Testing the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 to CAR-macrophages; 4) Verifying the protective effect of CAR-macrophages on Vero E6 cell line infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Experimental results: Results show that programmed CAR-macrophages were successfully constructed and characterized, and its function was initially verified in vitro. 1. CAR-macrophages can engulf SARS-CoV-2 virus particles; 2. CARMERTK-macrophages did not upregulate cytokine levels; 3. CAR-macrophages were not infected by SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: We successfully used CARs to induce the targeting of macrophages on spikes on the surface of pseudoviral particles. Compared with CAR-T therapy, macrophages were used as the chassis to give full play to the important role of macrophages in viral immunity. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines is not up-regulated in the process of phagocytosis of pseudovirions by CARMERTK-macrophages, which has high safety.

Aflatoxin is a strong carcinogen widely existing in feed crops. Aflatoxin residues in livestock deep-processing products seriously threaten food safety. This project uses Bacillus subtilis, which is generally considered safe, as a carrier to assemble aflatoxin degradation proteins, stable-phase promoters and self-cleavage protein. Combined with the selenium-enrichment function of Bacillus subtilis, a strain of intelligent Bacillus subtilis with self cleavage function, which can simultaneously degrade aflatoxin and enrich selenium, is constructed. Finally, a new, safe and selenium rich high-value feed additive is provided.

Examplified by polyethylene, undegradable plastics have a degradation period of hundreds of years under natural conditions, causing severe environmental crisis worldwide. Manganese peroxidase (MnP) uses hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce high-redox-potential Mn3+, possessing a PE-degrading potential. Our project takes MnP as our key PE-degrading enzyme, employs aryl alcohol oxidase (AAO) to provide H2O2 for MnP, and utilizes hydrophobin-1 (HFB1) to increase substrate accessibility, as well as combines SpyCatcher-SpyTag system with CRISPR/dCas9 system to anchor MnP, AAO and HFB1 onto one double-stranded DNA scaffold according to certain spatial order, distance and proportion. The final complex works as a molecular machine that can adhere and degrade PE in a green and swift way.\end{spacing}

Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disability. According to American CDC, prevalence of autism in the U.S. has increased from 1 in 68 births in 2010 to 1 in 54 births in 2020. Although autism is a biological disorder, it is primarily treated through education and behavioral services, with medication as an important adjunct. However, to date, there is no effective drug to treat ASD. Apart from genetic factors, the protentially dangerous environmental factors to the maternal generation, such as Maternal immune activation(MIA) and Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), can also be the cause of ASD. According to the gut-brain axis theory, whether it is maternal immune activation or genetic factors, the etiologies of autism are all related to the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome interacts intimately with the intestins. And CNS deseases such as ASD or stroke can modify the composition of the gut microbiome, leading to a vicious cycle where gut dysbiosis exacerbates the neuroimmune response and aggravates brain pathology and behavior.

Aiming at using synthetic biology to prevent and treat autism through gut-brain axis, our experimental designed involves two parts: prevention in the maternal generation and treatment in the fetal generation. Epidemiological studies suggest that, in humans, fetus’ exposure to maternal inflammation increases the likelihood of autism spectrum disorder. When the immune system of a will-be-mother is activated due to infections or autoinflammatory syndromes, the Th17 and Treg cells in her bowel will lose their balance and inflammatory factors, such as IL-17, can then be transferred across the placental barrier to harm the nervous system of the fetus. In this case, her child will have an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. So we decided to develop a probiotic strain of E. coli as a novel, self-tuning “drug” for pregnant women to reudce the risk of autism in the offspring. As for treatment in the fetal generation, we attempted to code secretable oxytocin, which can be transported to the central nervous system through the gut-brain axis.

Children with ASDs are also what we call ‘Children From the Star’. They are stars twinkling in the distant sky, all waiting for their time to drop on the earth but happening to be trapped in a bottle. And when the trapped one falls into a human’s bosom, the lady becomes his or her dear mother. When they grow up, they find it hard to make friends with other ‘normal’ kids. So the little one stays in his or her own planet, with nobody having ever landed on their planets and certain about what their planets are like. Our project aims at building up a stairway to the starlight, using engineering probiotics to prevent autism caused by maternal infection during pregnancy and treat children, thus structuring a way to health for the ‘Children From the Star’.\end{spacing}

Ginsenosides, as active components of ginseng, have many pharmacological activities. Among them, ginsenoside CK has been widely studied for its excellent biological activities such as treating diabetes, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and anti-aging. However, CK almost does not exist in natural ginseng and can be produced by ginsenoside Rb1 through enzymatic conversion. In order to improve CK production, this project expressed β -glucoside enzyme derived from sulphurite leaf vulcanization bacteria in Pichia pastoris GS115 and applied it to deglycosylation of Rb1 and production of CK.

In this project, the SS-bgly gene derived from Sulfolobus solfataricus will be highly expressed in pichia coli system after codon optimization, and the enzymatic reaction conditions for the transformation of ginsenoside substrate Rb1 to CK from SS-bgly will be explored. Under the optimized enzymatic reaction conditions, the recombinant SS-bgly can transform ginsenoside Rb1 with higher substrate concentration into CK, which is conducive to the large-scale production of CK.\end{spacing}

Tyrian purple, also known as, 6,6-dibromoindigo, is a kind of natural pigment with a long history of production and application, which was always been preferred by the royal. In addition to its value in history and culture, as a kind of novel biocompatible semiconductor it also receive much attention. However, due to natural yield little, difficulty in chemosynthesis and the potential pollution, its high yield production hasn’t been realized. Therefore, we plan to implement a two-cell reaction by spatiotemporally separating the two consecutive procedures of the production, so that the enzyme in tyrian purple metabolic pathway could achieve its highest efficiency. Moreover, we can choose some gene expression regulatory parts to improve the high-yield and high-purity dual cell system.

帝王紫，即6，6-二溴靛蓝，是拥有悠久生产与应用历史的天然染料，历史上一直为统治阶级所钟爱，除其承载的历史文化价值外，帝王紫作为新型生物相容性导体，在半导体材料中也倍受瞩目。但由于其天然产量少，化学合成困难且存在环境污染，迄今未能实现高产。本项目拟采用双细胞系统，进行生产时空分离，以达到帝王紫代谢通路中相关酶的最高利用效率，并严格筛选基因表达调控原件，构建帝王紫高纯度，高产量双细胞体系。\end{spacing}

Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease estimated to affect more than 339 million people worldwide. People suffering from asthma can only use different levels of ICS or ICS-LABA to prevent exacerbations and control symptoms. We focus on type 2 inflammation in bronchus, which is common but a key contributor to asthma. Our scheme is to take advantage of RNAi therapy to target TSLP and GATA3 to degrade their expression of mRNA and consequently improve asthma situations. During this process, we use a self-assembled siRNA delivery system where we enclose the siRNAs with exosomes to inhibit the above genes’ translation and to subsequently prevent downstream toxicity and immunogenicity, which is superior to the otherwise exogenously pre-assembled systems. Meanwhile, we connected with our community through human practices to raise awareness of asthma. To ensure our sustainable impact, we held a regional meetup and founded an organization called the Nanjing iGEM Association (NIA).\end{spacing}

Long and costly process lies between target discovery and drug approval. So, in recent decade, pharmaceutical corporations have been using distributed AI models to assist in accelerating the R & D cycle and reducing costs in multiple stages, yet the average cost is still increasing. For peptide drugs, that multiple stages come as follows: data collection, feature representation, AI model construction, rational design, peptide library construction, affinity prediction, animal model experimental test, clinical test and the last approval. By developing a general and integrated AI model of peptide directed evolution, we can generate an optimized peptide virtual library from the target protein in one step instead, only to be waited for the next animal model experiment. Based on the idea of generation antagonism networks (GAN) , we developed and combined multi-dimensional discriminant networks and a sequence generation network to compete with each other, quickly and finely generate multiple optimal solutions in the protein sequence space under the constraints of given targets and expected multi properties, as new potential peptide drugs, to achieve the goal of one-step generation of the most promising sequence library.\end{spacing}

Located in the humid and rainy south, the problem of mosquito repellent has been the concern of Guangzhou people. Mosquitoes are not only annoying, but what’s more, they can also spread various diseases, such as dengue fever, which is a great threat to human health. So, in tropical and subtropical areas, mosquito repellant products are in great demand. Nootkatone is a new mosquito repellent ingredient reported by EPA, which offers increased safety and stability, but high cost has caused production limitations. We plan to achieve high yield of nootkatone precursor (valencene) through promoter engineering. Firstly, we establish a promoter pool of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Then, we obtain stronger promoters that support high expression to synthesize valencene for most fermentation phases via alternation and recombination of upstream activated sequence (UAS). We establishe nucleosome affinity model to optimize the UAS of the hybrid promoter, so as to maximize the efficiency of the transcription, which ultimately helps achieve higher market shares of nootkatone, reduce production costs and let more people benefit from it.

地处潮湿多雨的南方，驱蚊问题一直备受广州人民的关注。蚊子不仅让人心烦意乱，更可怕的是，蚊子还会传播各种疾病，如登革热等对人类的健康造成极大威胁。因此在热带和亚热带地区，驱蚊产品有着很大的市场需求。圆柚酮是 EPA报道的新型驱蚊成分，具有更高的安全性和稳定性，但高昂的成本造成了生产限制。我们通过酿酒酵母的启动子工程实现圆柚酮前体(瓦伦烯)的高产量。我们首先建立酿酒酵母启动子库，并通过不同启动子的上游激活序列(UAS)的组合，获得了发酵早期和晚期均支持高表达的杂合启动子。接着我们建立核小体亲和力模型，对启动子进行优化，使转录效率最大化，从而提高诺卡酮前体(瓦伦烯)的生产量，最终使圆柚酮获得更高的市场份额，降低生产成本，让更多人受益。\end{spacing}

Since the implementation of household garbage sorting regulations in Shanghai, the amount of food waste has reached a peak. However, the health problems and unpleasant smell caused by odor generated from food waste have aroused attention not only in Shanghai but also in other areas. This year, Tongji China launches the “LOOK！” project to solve the odor of food waste. We construct two kinds of bioengineered E. coli to absorb hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, which are the two main ingredients in the odor. One uses enzymes related to sulfide oxidazation(Sqr, Sdo, AprBA and Sat), converting hydrogen sulfide to sulfate, while the other uses enzymes related to ammonia oxidazation (AMO, HAO and NOD), converting ammonia to nitrate. Besides, a three-gear adjustable kill switch based on the concentration of H2S and NH3 will be added to ensure biosafety. Also, we’ll optimize our pathway by high throughput screening and machine learning. We’ve conducted several rounds of Human Practices to gather suggestions from various aspects to improve our project. With such efforts, we hope that the problems the odor has brought to residents as well as waste disposal industries and their downstream industries can be solved in the future.\end{spacing}

Tryptophan, an essential amino acid, can be used as a food addictive to treat certain mental problems like insomnia and depression that greatly affect the life quality of the patients especially in modern society. Although the tryptophan supplied to the market is not shortage due to the mass production via chemical synthesis, patients of insomnia or depression still eager to get access to such chemicals or health products more conveniently. In other words, a tryptophan-producing, domestic and portable device is a latent and potential trend for the patients to get rid of redundant steps in purchasing tryptophan and certainly, to treat insomnia and depression.

In our project, E. coli is adapted to construct a brand new strain whose regular proliferation and tryptophan biosynthesis are separated and controlled through a bistable control system, i.e. toggle switch, without affecting the viability of the cells. If possible, we hope to build the device to produce and purify the tryptophan based on our edited strain.

In our toggle switch, faster cell proliferation is expected to be witnessed under the induction of IPTG, while paused proliferation and elevated tryptophan yield would be observed after a growing temperature shift to over 42℃. As for the circuit, critical genes for either E. coli proliferation or tryptophan synthesis are retrieved and picked on the basis of previously published research. Ultimately, pykA(for proliferation) and aroG&trpAB(for trp synthesis) were chosen to composite the toggle switch together with other necessary cis-acting elements. pykA encodes pyruvate kinase A in E. coli, which catalyzes the formation of pyruvate in the last step of glycolysis. Thus, the overexpression of pykA via exogenous plasmids is expected to result in an increase of pyruvate utilized by TCA cycle to produce additional NADH and ATP to support cell growth and division. However, glycolysis branches off at phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) because AroG catalyzes the formation of DAHP from PEP, and eventually tryptophan is synthesized due to a set of successive enzymes including trpAB. Hence, overexpression of aroG and trpAB elevates the tryptophan yield level but on the other hand affects the cell proliferation.\end{spacing}

CEPI (Confederation of European Paper Industries) has reported that the recycling rate of office waste paper (OWP) is dramatically low (12.9\%) in Europe though this kind of paper has a high value to regenerate. In addition, our market research has produced similar results. We find that cellulase, xylanase, lipase, and laccase will allow biodeinking to occur, by helping the ink detach from the waste paper and decomposing hazardous substances. In our project, we designed a new surface assembly of a functional cellulosome by using a synthetic yeast consortium, Pichia pastoris. The basic design of the consortiums consisted of five different engineered yeast strains are capable of displaying a trifunctional scaffolding carrying two divergent cohesion domains from Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium cellulolyticum in proportion 2:1, secreting the two corresponding dockerin-tagged cellulase and xylanase and the other two enzymes named lipase and laccase. The secreted cellulase and xylanase are docked onto the displayed Scaffolding in a highly organized manner based on the specific interaction of the two cohesin-dockerin pairs, resulting in the assembly of a functional cellulosome on the yeast surface. To bring our idea to the real world, we design a paper recycle machine (Deinker), mainly including the transmission part, the enzyme liquid smearing part, the deinking part, and the paper drying part. When using, the paper only needs to be fixed on the cardboard, and the deinking can be started with one button on the touch screen. Finally, you can get a piece of white paper that can be used again. Through this device, the office waste paper will be reborn. In addition, mathematical models are built for improving experiments, hardware, and implementation: A model for specific protein structure prediction and molecular docking; a model for predicting the optimum ratio and reaction conditions of various enzymes; a model for ink recognition on the paper surface; a model for improving the drying efficiency of paper by increasing the performance of the machine; a decision-making model of optimal placement of deinker in different application scenarios. Prospectively, our research project can not only recycle office paper but also reduce the cost of printing errors and prevent the leakage of information. Deink the dark make the world better with less tree cut.\end{spacing}

Wide spreading and utilization of plastic PET (polyethylene terephthalate) in the world has caused a large quantity of environmental challenges and gained much attention. In response, microbe Ideonella sakaiensis was reported to be capable of secreting two efficient enzymes to deconstruct PET polymers in environment. Hydrophobin in fungi can cupture PET and insert PET chains to divide them into partial line, which PETase can bond easily. However, this two-enzyme system degradation capacity may be highly limited due to inhibition effects and diffusion of intermediates. Therefore, we design a delicate multicomplex enzyme system, in which short peptide tags (RIAD and RIDD) are applied to create scaffold-free enzyme assemblies. Here, in order to capture and degrade microplastic PET particles effectively, we construct enzymes of PETase and MHETase and hydrophobin into our complex system, which reveal high catalytic efficiency in experiments. So we are hoping to make our efforts on the solution of plastic pollution. We plan to use E.coli and Chiamydomonas reinhardtii as chassis creature. Also, we pay more attention to biosafety in our project. We design several kill switches in the two chassis creature, to make sure their cells and modified genes will not be new threat or pollution.\end{spacing}

Currently, the world is still faced with the COVID-19 epidemic caused by novel coronavirus which urgently requires flexible and targeted protection measures. Novel coronavirus belongs to the family of forward RNA viruses. The spike proteins on its surface bind to the human cell surface receptors called ACE2 and then enter the cell through endocytosis. Reducing the expression of ACE2 does not cause significant structural abnormalities. Therefore, recognizing and inhibiting the expression level of ACE2 is considered to be an effective treatment for COVID-19. CRISPR-Cas13d is an RNA-guided ribonuclease which targets ssRNA. The RNA-targeted ribonuclease activity of Cas13d is independent of the specific adjacent sequences, which meets the requirements of rapid development of gRNA.

SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects the human respiratory and digestive systems. It causes disease through direct cytotoxic effects and inducing inflammatory response. We select human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T), lung cells (HLF-a), colorectal cells (CCD-18Co) and gastric cells (GES-1) to establish hACE2 stable transfection lines respectively and lentivirus with novel coronavirus spike protein is used as pseudovirus. Through bioinformatics screening of crRNA pool for ACE2 conserved sequence, the lentivirus /CRISPR-Cas13d system was constructed. Specific crRNA-mediated Cas13d system is used to target and knock down the mRNA level of ACE2 in four stable cell lines, which leads to a decrease in the expression of the receptor protein ACE2 on the cell surface. Thus, entry of the pseudovirus into cells was inhibited. We will use vitro and cell experiments to verify the effect of CRISPR-Cas13d system designed by us.\end{spacing}

Some places are heavily polluted by selenium-oxide ions, while some places lack selenium and even suffer from it, especially in China. Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) are a kind of elemental selenium wrapped in biological macromolecules such as proteins. Compared with other forms of selenium, it has the advantages of low toxicity, high efficiency, smaller particle size and higher activity, and has been widely used in medicine, agriculture, animal husbandry and other aspects. Some microorganisms have the nutural ability to reduce selenium-oxide anions to SeNPs. However, they are not always perfect. There are problems such as low reduction efficiency and low activity due to large particle size of SeNPs. We chose E. coli MG1655, which has the natural ability of reducing selenium oxide anions to SeNPs, as the chassis, added Csr F enzyme and Sef  A protein which could improve the reduction rate. Finally, a high-efficient selenium recovery bioreactor with higher reduction rate and higher product activity was obtained. The SeNPs produced in the bioreactor has been used to inhibit drug-resistant bacteria, adsorb heavy metal ions and improve the quality of crops with satisfactory results.\end{spacing}

Due to the large-scale use of antibiotics, environmental pollution and food residues have posed a great threat to the ecological environment as well as human health. Therefore, this project aims to design a series of high-performance whole cell biosensors (WCBs) to detect antibiotics. To overcome the common limits of WCBs, a fluorescence-activated RNA aptamer is used as the output signal to increase the response speed, and it is hoped that the signal-noise ratio and dynamic range of the sensor can be improved by the NIMPLY logic gate gene circuit composed of CRISPRi and strand replacement reactions.

由于抗生素的大规模使用，其造成的环境污染和食品残留问题对生态环境与健康安全已造成了威胁，故本项目以四环素类和大环内酯类抗生素为例，设计了高性能的全细胞生物传感器用以检测抗生素。为克服全细胞生物传感器常见的各种限制，本项目将一种荧光激活RNA适配体作为输出信号以增加传感器响应速度，并希望通过由CRISPRi和链置换反应组成的NIMPLY逻辑门基因线路提高传感器的信噪比 (signal-noise ratio) 和动态范围。\end{spacing}

This year our team is working on P. aeruginosa infection and wound repair in burn treatment. Using principles of synthetic biology, we genetically modified Gluconacetobacter xylinus ATCC53582 to kill P. aeruginosa specifically through the production and release of chimeric bacteriocin SE protein and the immune protein. Moreover, the production of cellulose in the engineered Gluconacetobacter xylinus ATCC53582 was regulated by blue light，which can further prevent infection of other bacteria and promote wound repair.\end{spacing}

Our project aims to remove caffeine from drinks by synthetic biology methods. To achieve this goal, we will convert caffeine into healthful theacrine through a two-step enzymatic reaction in a cell-free system. This process requires two enzymes: Cdh and CkTcS, which will be produced by our engineered bacteria modified by synthetic biology methods These two enzymes can utilize CoQ(0) and SAM to turn caffeine into theacrine. For this aim, we will also use engineered bacteria for fermentatve production of SAM. In addition, we I use the PUTR-CRP global transcrptional regulatory system to enhance the expression of target genes. All our genetically modified engineered bacteria will be strictly confined to the laboratory culture, and we will also transfer the cryo-induced suicide module relB-relE+Ptrc into them to eliminate the risk of engineered bacteria’s leaking. Finally, all substances needed in the decaffeine process will be purified, sterilized and then added to the cartridges. Through this. we can ensure that our cartridges can be used to filter drinks without causing harm to humans and the environment.\end{spacing}

But recently there is still lack of tools that is user-friendly and can integrate existing model and software. Thus, CAT, Convenient Accurate Tool, is designed. Based on the purpose of offering an highly-efficient software to our user, we collect some important properties of protein sequence. Moreover, we combine CAT with education and build up a education version in order to briefly introduce the models and the achievement that machine learning has done in synthetic biology. By the education version, we hope that CAT can motivate students’ interest and make further contribution in the area of synthetic biology and machine learning.

如今机器学习在各个领域都有着显著的成果，并且在合成生物学领域也做出了极大的贡献，例如能精准预测蛋白质三级结构的Alphafold2。但是现在还缺乏一个用户友好且将这些模型整合在一起的工具，CAT由此诞生了，我们集结一些重要的属性预测，使用户能高效的得到想要的结果，并且结合教育，搭建一个教育版，介绍所用模型以及应用在合成生物学中的成果。\end{spacing}

We design a biocircuit with four different modules: a light module, an optogenetic switch module, a GABA module, and a lysis module. The light module contains light-generating genes luxCDABE under the control of a T7 promoter and a lac operator. The optogenetic switch module contains a light-switchable domain VVD and a split recombinase Cre under the control of a pLac promoter. The GABA module and lysis module contain a GABA-producing enzyme gadB and a lysis protein φX174E under the control of a PW4 promoter and a LoxP-terminator-LoxP fragment. LuxAB is a luciferase which can utilize the aldehyde made by LuxCDE to produce blue-green light. When exposed to blue light, VVDs change conformation to allow dimerization, which brings the Cre fragments together to make it an active recombinase. Cre recombinase then recognize and excise DNA fragments flanked by two loxP sites. The excision eliminates the terminator placed 3’ of the promoter, so the following genes can be transcribed and translated into GadB and φX174E proteins. GadB catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to GABA. φX174E induces cell wall lysis to release intracellular GABAs into human gut environment.\end{spacing}

Acne is a common skin disease. Generally speaking, acne is related to pores being blocked by sebum and propionibacterium acnes proliferating in such an anaerobic environment. Our project aims at acne caused by such factors and hopes to develop a drug for acne treatment with less side effects and convenience. On the one hand, our engineering bacteria have stronger ability to break down fatty acids, unblocking the pores, which will destroy the anaerobic environment. On the other hand, our engineering bacteria can secrete bacteriocin which is able to kill propionibacterium acnes. At the same time, in order to ensure the precise synthesis and secretion of killing substances, we added fatty acid-sensitive promoters before bacteriocin. We hope to further optimize the function of the promoters by means of directed evolution. In terms of safety, we will prevent environmental pollution or other safety threats by using nutritionally deficient engineered bacteria.\end{spacing}

In 2010, acne was the eighth epidemic, accounting for 9.38\% of the global population. From 2006 to 2016, the global prevalence of acne increased by 5.1\%. The human body’s innate immunity and inflammation of P. acnes is the key to acne pathology and sequelae. Therefore, we designed an engineered bacteria that can bind to the base of the mask express two fusion proteins under infrared-induced condition. The two fusion proteins can be aggregated into nanospheres to achieve killing and blocking of Propionibacterium acnes. Inflammation can achieve the purpose of curing acne and repairing the skin. We have successfully expressed our proteins and achieved temperature-controlled self-aggregation in vitro.\end{spacing}

Selenium plays an important role in balancing the systems in human bodies and sustaining the stability of human organs. Selenium deficiency would cause severe diseases like Keshan diseases, Cataracts, Diabetes, and other organic diseases in body systems.

Selenium deficiency is prevailing globally. Moreover, China is one of the countries that has tens of thousands of people suffer from its relevant diseases because nearly 72 percent of the land are lack of selenium supply to the crops and livestock while eating is the primary approach of absorbing Se.

Solutions are not efficacious and advantageous enough and problems remain. The common selenium supplements cure only the symptoms, and the supplements can seldom control the amount absorb by body, which will cause selenosis if over-ingestion take place. Besides, synthesizing selenium in chemical media has a low output capacity, producing toxic by-products that might contaminate the environment and threaten the health of human bodies.

With our discovery of Staphylococcus aureus LZ-01, a special bacteria that act as an enhancer for the production of SeNPs supplements, the output capacity of SeNPs will dramatically increase and the synthesis will no longer rely on poisonous and unstable chemical and physical conditions.\end{spacing}

Antibiotics, which served as an agent that can kill the bacteria effectively, plays a crucial role in treating and preventing bacterial infection. However, it was abused in many fields, especially animal husbandry. Over the recent years, the use of antibiotics has caused heated debate and controversy. Meanwhile, the degradation efficiency of antibiotics has not kept pace with their wide range of animal hunsbandry applications. Scientists hypothesized that the consumption of antibiotics in edible animal will surge from 23\% in 2010 to 30\% in 2030. The harm of adding antibiotics in feed is mainly reflected in two aspects: the accumulation in poultries, and the increasing in the resistance of bacteria, which may lead to the form of super-bacteria that could be detrimental to both environment and living beings.

While, Conventional methods like high temperature composting, fermentation and microbial degradation have some potential problems including low efficiency and high costs. Effective new methods are urgently needed.

Fortunately, the Whole Cell Biocatalyst Ecn-IL, can be a favorable solution to the mentioned issue. With the technology of cell surface display, the Laccase gene (lacc6) which originated from Pleurotus ostreatus can be displayed on the surface of Probiotic E. coli, Nissle 1917 (EcN), and form a membrane-like mechanism to decompose the antibiotics residues. The utilization of the Ecn-Il can effectively avoid the accumulation of the antibiotics in animals. Besides, without the mountainous usages of antibiotics, the tolerability can be largely reduced, and thus the formation of the super-bacteria can also be avoided. More importantly, the Ecn-IL is friendly to the environment. Specifically, when using the Ecn-IL, people can save much resources and eliminate the residual of the antibiotics that lie in the waste-water, soil, and animals’ excrement at the same time.\end{spacing}

Microalgae, as one of the photosynthetic organisms with high carbon sequestration efficiency, have become a promising research area to achieve the goal of “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality”. The team took the common single-cell oil-producing diatom Trionyxus triangularis as the starting point, and used synthetic biology, molecular biology, bioinformatics, biochemistry, pharmacology, metabolomics, transcriptomics, etc. to explore the connection between microalgae oil synthesis and related key genes, based on which the engineered microalgae were constructed. At the same time, the completed strains will be combined with laboratory results for modeling and further screening of engineered microalgae suitable for large-scale plant applications. The research results obtained by the team will actively and effectively provide a new impetus to combat climate change, energy shortage and green low-carbon development. In addition, together with domestic and international experts, scholars and entrepreneurs in the same field, we will promote the achievement of China’s and global carbon peak and carbon neutral goals.\end{spacing}

Rice is an important food crop in the world.  For a long time, excessive cadmium in rice has seriously affected the grain yield and human health.  OsNramp5 is the main absorption channel of Mn2+ and Cd2+ in rice roots.  Current modification on OsNramp5 managed to reduce the absorption of Cd2+, at the cost of lack of Mn2+, resulting in rice yield reduction.  Therefore, we tried to obtain a mutant through directed evolution, which could achieve low Cd2+ absorption and at the same time meet the normal requirements of rice for Mn2+.  We constructed OsNramp5 mutant library by error-prone PCR and we respectively performed high-throughput screening in yeast using cadmium probe and manganese probe.  After preliminary screening and sequencing, coupled with site-directed mutagenesis, we expect to achieve the accumulation and iteration of favorable mutations.  We hope that the evolved mutant protein can be used in the cultivation of low-cadmium rice to produce a healthy crop.\end{spacing}

17 α-ethynyl estradiol (EE2) is an artificial estrogen with a strong estrogenic effect.

The main component of contraceptives, EE2, will cause some serious diseases after intake. Because of no effective degradation method, estrogens are still accumulating in the environment. Therefore, HI-ZJU team decided to solve EE2 pollution problem. We obtained two target genes, amoA and hao, which can degrade EE2 by the way of co-metabolism, from ammonia oxidizing bacteria. Using these genes, we are able to create bacteria that can degrade EE2 by gene editing. Meanwhile, hold a pragmatic standpoint of our wastewater treatment practice (WWTP), we managed to making acquaintance with the local authority in charge of waste water recycling. Staff there introduce us to develop a treatment with high-sensibility of detecting the soluble 17 α-ethynyl estradiol in natural condition, whose percentage composition present to be relevantly low in order of magnitudes. Taking low level of EE2‘s background concentration in consideration, we managed to develop an effective and synthetic biological cascade amplification reaction superior to its rudimental form, which is competent to capture the EE2 via hydrophobic interaction between amino acid residue. We employ the artificial intelligence, a series of programs modified to bring upon hybrid on mutant site and calculate the combining Gibbs Free energy to sort out the best choice. In addition we attach a visible measurement he Green fluorescent protein (GFP), to the expression sequence of plasmid, which can linear indicates the content of EE2 in waste water.\end{spacing}

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), whose victim almost covers all mammalian species, is an immune-mediated disease at the intersection of complex interactions between genetics, environment and gut microbiota. Compared with human-beings, pets are not able to voice their current health status directly; thus, delayed diagnosis becomes a common phenomenon. Taking the most common pets- dogs as objects, HZAU-China aims to develop a method based on synthetic biology to detect IBD at an early stage. The engineered bacteria have the capability to sense the concentration of biomarkers, giving feedbacks and releasing therapeutic protein if IBD occurs. Probiotic capability of our engineered bacteria will be enhanced since heterologous health-care units are constantly produced. In the future, our project will be further ameliorated so as to apply this detective method to more kinds of mammals.\end{spacing}

Optogenetic tools provide essential approaches to control designer cell function. Our project intends to optimize Predator Pro, a modularized protein degradation system we’ve been working on in the past few years, to achieve light-mediated degradation of endogenous cyclin D1, a key regulator protein in cell cycle, thereby manipulating cell cycle in mammalian cells. Integrating with a raspberry pie-based blue light illumination device, our system enables convenient control of cell cycle synchronization and remote spatiotemporal control of cell division. Our work may provide novel tools for fundamental research and therapeutic purposes, including dealing with complex diseases like superficial cancer, melanoma, psoriasis or chronic skin wounds, which are all caused by cell abnormal division.\end{spacing}

It is not uncommon in bio-factories and laboratorie that people need to regulate the behavior of target organisms again and again. It is an difficult task. So, we build Phoebus. The core module of Phoebus is an opto-controllable element designer, which guide users to choose appropriate opto-switches and linker to rebuild target protein into opto-controllable element, predict the structure of the fusion protein and evaluate its acticity. User still need specific plugins for specific situations, and we will provide two plugins as examples: (1) opto-controllable enzyme oligomerization for light control of cascade reactions, and (2) opto-controllable transcription, for light control of transcription rate.\end{spacing}

Nuclear power is an important source in electricity production, and it always needs to be built on coast for its huge requirement of cooling water. However, marine organisms such as Phaeocystis globosa and Mytilus eduli sometimes cause blockage, resulting in the low efficiency of the water cooling system. There are few means available to solve these problems currently.

Here, we show our inspiration that the Lectin-SpyTag/SpyCatcher can pull down P. globosa colonies and then the HutH-fused proteins suppress the activity of P. globosa. To inhibit M. eduli fouling, Vibrio natriegens are engineered to express LCIKR2, which functions to attach engineered bacteria to the appendicular plastic cover on the coarse grille. What’s more, engineered bacteria which express 3NM8 and TnaA are used to inhibit M. eduli attachment on the coarse grille. Genes rhlA and rhlB are also introduced, which are necessary for bioproduction of rhamnolipids, a surfactant that can remove protection of mussel foot protein (mfp). As for biosafety, a blue-light-activated device, pDawn, is implemented to control the expression of toxic protein BlrA, which can constrain the engineered bacteria in a reservoir with two blue light strips upstream and downstream.\end{spacing}

Rhamnolipid is an important family of biosurfactant, which has been extensively used in many application scenarios in place of its chemically synthesized counterparts.

For commercial production, natural producer Pseudomonas aeruginosa is commonly used, whereas its pathogenicity is a huge problem. Safer chassis like Escherichia coli have been also engineered to produce rhamnolipids, but give less yield.

To further increase the yield of rhamnolipids, we plan to perform directed evolution on rhamnolipid synthesis enzymes in E. coli, using an improved version of EvolvR mutator with higher mutation rate and larger mutation window.

Based on rhamnosidase and rhamnose inducible promoter, a rhamnolipid sensor will be designed, enabling us to couple rhamnolipid biosynthesis to detectable output (e.g. fluorescent protein) or cell growth under certain selective pressure.

Combining EvolvR mutator and rhamnolipid biosensor, Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and continuous directed evolution will be performed to screen out enzyme variants with higher efficiency.

Our work will not only increase the yield and safety of rhamnolipid production, but also have great potential to enhance the production of other bio-products sharing similar biosynthesis pathway.\end{spacing}

Every year, about 14,000 tons of sunscreen are deposited into the ocean, producing a large amount of chemical pollution, especially oxybenzone and octyl-methoxycinnamate. This has greatly worsened the phenomenon of coral bleaching.

To alleviate the current situation, we are developing an environmentally-friendly bio-sunscreen that is harmless to coral reefs and the marine ecosystem. Inspired by how animals and plants in nature protect themselves from UV rays, we have decided to produce gadusol, a natural UV filter originated from zebrafish, as the main component of our bio-sunscreen product. We will introduce the synthetic pathways of gadusol into Saccharomyces cerevisiae and engineer it into a cell factory to balance the use of sunscreen and the protection of coral reefs.\end{spacing}

With the increasing exacerbation of antibiotics’ overuse, more and more antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains have emerged. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered one of the promising alternatives to antibiotics. Escherichia coli is the first microorganism to be extensively used for the production of recombinant proteins. However, the expression of AMPs genes is problematic due to the toxicity of the proteins to the expression host. In order to improve the production of various AMPs, the RBS library of T7 RNA polymerase based on the E. coli BL21 (DE3) will be constructed using CRISPR gene editing tools. For target AMPs, the most suitable expression host could be screened for library in only three days, thus realizing private antimicrobial peptide customization. Based on this, our project covers two aspects: the construction of library and the application of library. We aim to protect the human health and environment by reducing the abuse of antibiotics.\end{spacing}

The next decade is a pivotal period in tackling climate change. To achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement and restrict the temperature rise within 1.5°C, the annual carbon reduction rate by 2030 should reach 11.7\%, which is fivefold the current rate. To achieve these goals, the world’s energy mix requires a rapid transition to renewable and low-carbon energy. Low-carbon hydrogen can be used as a powerful substitute for hydrocarbons, according to the International Energy Agency, the predicted global demand for hydrogen will increase sevenfold to 520 million tons from 2019 to 2070.

Compared with traditional methods, biohydrogen production has more advantages in terms of cost and environmental benefits. As low-cost clean energy, biohydrogen shares extensive market prospects. SJTang hopes that by optimizing the hydrogen production metabolic pathways and cultivation approaches of E. coli and R.palustris, the efficiency of biological hydrogen production can be further improved, and thereby reducing unit costs. In the meantime, we plan to calculate the greenhouse gas emission of cellular activities, develop quantitative hardware, and establish operating procedures and best practice guidelines for greenhouse gas tracking in the production cycle.

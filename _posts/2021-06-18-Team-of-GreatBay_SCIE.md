### A High-School Therapeutics Project

Our project aims at utilizing aptamers and nanoparticles to develop a new type of breast cancer targeting-drugs. Using aptamers as guide molecules can provide us with advantages such as lower production costs and shorter production period; nanoparticles can increase the stability of our drug delivery system and reduce its cytotoxicity.

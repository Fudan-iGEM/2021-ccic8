### An Environment Project

Wide spreading and utilization of plastic PET (polyethylene terephthalate) in the world has caused a large quantity of environmental challenges and gained much attention. In response, microbe Ideonella sakaiensis was reported to be capable of secreting two efficient enzymes to deconstruct PET polymers in environment. Hydrophobin in fungi can cupture PET and insert PET chains to divide them into partial line, which PETase can bond easily. However, this two-enzyme system degradation capacity may be highly limited due to inhibition effects and diffusion of intermediates. Therefore, we design a delicate multicomplex enzyme system, in which short peptide tags (RIAD and RIDD) are applied to create scaffold-free enzyme assemblies. Here, in order to capture and degrade microplastic PET particles effectively, we construct enzymes of PETase and MHETase and hydrophobin into our complex system, which reveal high catalytic efficiency in experiments. So we are hoping to make our efforts on the solution of plastic pollution. We plan to use E.coli and Chiamydomonas reinhardtii as chassis creature. Also, we pay more attention to biosafety in our project. We design several kill switches in the two chassis creature, to make sure their cells and modified genes will not be new threat or pollution.

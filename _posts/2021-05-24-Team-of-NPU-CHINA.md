### A Food &amp; Nutrition Project

Aflatoxin is a strong carcinogen widely existing in feed crops. Aflatoxin residues in livestock deep-processing products seriously threaten food safety. This project uses *Bacillus subtilis*, which is generally considered safe, as a carrier to assemble aflatoxin degradation proteins, stable-phase promoters and self-cleavage protein. Combined with the selenium-enrichment function of *Bacillus subtilis*, a strain of intelligent *Bacillus subtilis* with self cleavage function, which can simultaneously degrade aflatoxin and enrich selenium, is constructed. Finally, a new, safe and selenium rich high-value feed additive is provided. 

黄曲霉素是广泛存在于饲料作物的强致癌物质，牲畜食用后残留于深加工产品的黄曲霉毒素严重威胁食品安全。本项目以普遍认为安全的枯草芽孢杆菌为载体，对黄曲霉毒素降解蛋白、稳定期启动的启动子和自裂解蛋白等元件进行组装。结合枯草芽孢杆菌富硒功能，本项目构建了一株稳定期自裂解的智能黄曲霉毒素降解和富硒枯草芽孢杆菌。最终，提供一种新型、安全、富硒的高值饲料添加剂。

Rice is an important food crop in the world.  For a long time, excessive cadmium in rice has seriously affected the grain yield and human health.  OsNramp5 is the main absorption channel of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup> in rice roots.  Current modification on OsNramp5 managed to reduce the absorption of Cd<sup>2+</sup>, at the cost of lack of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, resulting in rice yield reduction.  Therefore, we tried to obtain a mutant through directed evolution, which could achieve low Cd<sup>2+</sup> absorption and at the same time meet the normal requirements of rice for Mn<sup>2+</sup>.  We constructed OsNramp5 mutant library by error-prone PCR and we respectively performed high-throughput screening in yeast using cadmium probe and manganese probe.  After preliminary screening and sequencing, coupled with site-directed mutagenesis, we expect to achieve the accumulation and iteration of favorable mutations.  We hope that the evolved mutant protein can be used in the cultivation of low-cadmium rice to produce a healthy crop.

### A Manufacturing Project

苯乙醇因具有玫瑰香气而广泛用于化妆品等领域。本项目以酿酒酵母为底盘细胞，通过优化不同来源、不同表达方式的苯乙胺途径；强化内源醇脱氢酶活性；建立基于营养互补、代谢物交换的酵母-微藻双菌体系；结合3D打印微胶囊包埋技术，最终建立系统鲁棒、稳定、可控的苯乙醇绿色高效生物合成的人工双菌体系。

Phenylethanol has been widely used in cosmetics and other fields owing to its rose aroma. This project chooses Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the chassis microorganism, optimizes the phenethylamine pathway of different sources and different expression modes, strengthens the activity of endogenous alcohol dehydrogenase, establishes a yeast-microalgae microbial consortia system based on nutritional complementation and metabolites exchange. The combination with 3D printing microcapsule embedding technology will eventually guide to establish a robust, stable, and controllable artificial microbial consortia system for the green and efficiency phenylethanol biosynthetic.

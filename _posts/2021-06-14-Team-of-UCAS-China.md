Our project aims to remove caffeine from drinks by synthetic biology methods. To achieve this goal, we will convert caffeine into healthful theacrine through a two-step enzymatic reaction in a cell-free system. This process requires two enzymes: Cdh and CkTcS, which will be produced by our engineered bacteria modified by synthetic biology methods These two enzymes can utilize CoQ(0) and SAM to turn caffeine into theacrine. For this aim, we will also use engineered bacteria for fermentatve production of SAM. In addition, we I use the PUTR-CRP global transcrptional regulatory system to enhance the expression of target genes. All our genetically modified engineered bacteria will be strictly confined to the laboratory culture, and we will also transfer the cryo-induced suicide module relB-relE+Ptrc into them to eliminate the risk of engineered bacteria's leaking. Finally, all substances needed in the decaffeine process will be purified, sterilized and then added to the cartridges. Through this. we can ensure that our cartridges can be used to filter drinks without causing harm to humans and the environment.

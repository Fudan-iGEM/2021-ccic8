## Overcoming Challenges

A **sustainable** world remains diverse and fosters long-term wellbeing across all dimensions. The younger generation must play a leading role in carving such a future - their future. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic effect on the ability of schools around the world to educate and prepare students ready for the challenging future.

Authentic research projects, especially iGEM projects, **inspire and equip** students to make lasting impacts in their local communities beyond schools, while at the same time motivating advisors to enthusiastically **guide and empower** their students. This is the ideal, but in a period of a public health crisis, hampered interpersonal communication, reduced support for early-stage projects from agencies, and many uncertainties surrounding the world, sustaining the ideal is challenging.

However, there are predecessors who have overcome all those challenges. In bringing together students and advisors from different parts of China, CCiC8 will be a forum **to exchange experience and adventures**, between old and young, junior and senior, to ensure that the practices and cultures we value are sustained into the future, and our students will **be ready** to overcome their coming challenges.

### A New Application Project

According to literature, various RNA molecules in urine or blood have proven to serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases. Herein, we are developing a cell-free RNA biosensor, which comprises a cell-free system, engineered DNA transcription templates and RNA-responsive CRISPR/Cas9 System. We hope our project will provide patients with a simple, safe, low-cost diagnostic method.

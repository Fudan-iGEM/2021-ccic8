### A Diagnostics Project

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), whose victim almost covers all mammalian species, is an immune-mediated disease at the intersection of complex interactions between genetics, environment and gut microbiota. Compared with human-beings, pets are not able to voice their current health status directly; thus, delayed diagnosis becomes a common phenomenon. Taking the most common pets- dogs as objects, HZAU-China aims to develop a method based on synthetic biology to detect IBD at an early stage. The engineered bacteria have the capability to sense the concentration of biomarkers, giving feedbacks and releasing therapeutic protein if IBD occurs. Probiotic capability of our engineered bacteria will be enhanced since heterologous health-care units are constantly produced. In the future, our project will be further ameliorated so as to apply this detective method to more kinds of mammals.

### A Therapeutics Project

Our project aims to find a new method of treating type 1 diabetes with the help of synthetic biology. Our engineered cells will be implanted subcutaneously by mature embedding technology. Blue light activates the automatic insulin production pathway in the cell, meanwhile, its sensation of insulin concentration acts as a detector to cut off the pathway in time to ensure safety.

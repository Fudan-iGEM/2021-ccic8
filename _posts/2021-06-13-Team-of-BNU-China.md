### A Manufacturing Project

In some natural colonies, microorganisms cooperate with each other by sharing essential substances. However, some "cheaters" who use public resources without synthesis emerge in the process of evolution. When cheaters appear in the industrial production, it may cause a loss in both quality and quantity of the products. To solve this problem, BNU-China develops a "cheater-proof" platform for industrial production by introducing automatically switchable "guards" into the system.

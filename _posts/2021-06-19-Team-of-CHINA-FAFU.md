### An Energy Project

Microalgae, as one of the photosynthetic organisms with high carbon sequestration efficiency, have become a promising research area to achieve the goal of "carbon peaking and carbon neutrality". The team took the common single-cell oil-producing diatom Trionyxus triangularis as the starting point, and used synthetic biology, molecular biology, bioinformatics, biochemistry, pharmacology, metabolomics, transcriptomics, etc. to explore the connection between microalgae oil synthesis and related key genes, based on which the engineered microalgae were constructed. At the same time, the completed strains will be combined with laboratory results for modeling and further screening of engineered microalgae suitable for large-scale plant applications. The research results obtained by the team will actively and effectively provide a new impetus to combat climate change, energy shortage and green low-carbon development. In addition, together with domestic and international experts, scholars and entrepreneurs in the same field, we will promote the achievement of China's and global carbon peak and carbon neutral goals.

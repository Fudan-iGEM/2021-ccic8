### A High-School Project

Our goal is to develop a whole-cell biocatalyst by displaying PETase on the surface of yeast cell (*Candida tropicalis*) to degrade PET waste by homologous recombination. The project tested 89 anchor proteins using GFP as the reporter gene and selected the best one to fuse with PETase. We hope the yeast with surfaced PETase can improve the PET degradation efficiency.

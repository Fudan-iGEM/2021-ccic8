### A Software Project

Based on the interactions of phage and bacteria according to consistent sequences, we try to establish an interactive map called Phage-MAP, which demonstrates the potentially corresponding relationship between phage and bacteria. It is pretty conducive to select specific phage or phage combinations to achieve precise treatment to a certain bacterium.

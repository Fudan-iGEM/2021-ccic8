We design a biocircuit with four different modules: a light module, an optogenetic switch module, a GABA module, and a lysis module. The light module contains light-generating genes luxCDABE under the control of a T7 promoter and a lac operator. The optogenetic switch module contains a light-switchable domain VVD and a split recombinase Cre under the control of a pLac promoter. The GABA module and lysis module contain a GABA-producing enzyme gadB and a lysis protein φX174E under the control of a PW4 promoter and a LoxP-terminator-LoxP fragment. LuxAB is a luciferase which can utilize the aldehyde made by LuxCDE to produce blue-green light. When exposed to blue light, VVDs change conformation to allow dimerization, which brings the Cre fragments together to make it an active recombinase. Cre recombinase then recognize and excise DNA fragments flanked by two loxP sites. The excision eliminates the terminator placed 3’ of the promoter, so the following genes can be transcribed and translated into GadB and φX174E proteins. GadB catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to GABA. φX174E induces cell wall lysis to release intracellular GABAs into human gut environment.

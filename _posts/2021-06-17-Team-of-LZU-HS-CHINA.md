Selenium plays an important role in balancing the systems in human bodies and sustaining the stability of human organs. Selenium deficiency would cause severe diseases like Keshan diseases, Cataracts, Diabetes, and other organic diseases in body systems.

Selenium deficiency is prevailing globally. Moreover, China is one of the countries that has tens of thousands of people suffer from its relevant diseases because nearly 72 percent of the land are lack of selenium supply to the crops and livestock while eating is the primary approach of absorbing Se.

Solutions are not efficacious and advantageous enough and problems remain. The common selenium supplements cure only the symptoms, and the supplements can seldom control the amount absorb by body, which will cause selenosis if over-ingestion take place. Besides, synthesizing selenium in chemical media has a low output capacity, producing toxic by-products that might contaminate the environment and threaten the health of human bodies.

With our discovery of Staphylococcus aureus LZ-01, a special bacteria that act as an enhancer for the production of SeNPs supplements, the output capacity of SeNPs will dramatically increase and the synthesis will no longer rely on poisonous and unstable chemical and physical conditions.

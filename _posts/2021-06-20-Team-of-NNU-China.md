### A Manufacturing Project

With the increasing exacerbation of antibiotics’ overuse, more and more antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains have emerged. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered one of the promising alternatives to antibiotics. Escherichia coli is the first microorganism to be extensively used for the production of recombinant proteins. However, the expression of AMPs genes is problematic due to the toxicity of the proteins to the expression host. In order to improve the production of various AMPs, the RBS library of T7 RNA polymerase based on the *E. coli* BL21 (DE3) will be constructed using CRISPR gene editing tools. For target AMPs, the most suitable expression host could be screened for library in only three days, thus realizing private antimicrobial peptide customization. Based on this, our project covers two aspects: the construction of library and the application of library. We aim to protect the human health and environment by reducing the abuse of antibiotics.

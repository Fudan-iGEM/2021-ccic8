### A Software Project

The current DNA computation and its application are still in the laboratory stage，which is difficult to apply DNA computation for researchers without rich professional knowledge. This project aims to build a comprehensive dynamic DNA computing work platform to assist scientific researchers in accelerating the progress of research. This platform integrates bioinformatics analysis, machine learning models and molecular dynamics simulation to achieve design guidance and predictive simulation of dynamic DNA computation sequences. It can be applied to low-cost, non-invasive, and conventional early cancer screening.

### A Food &amp; Nutrition Project

Tryptophan, an essential amino acid, can be used as a food addictive to treat certain mental problems like insomnia and depression that greatly affect the life quality of the patients especially in modern society. Although the tryptophan supplied to the market is not shortage due to the mass production via chemical synthesis, patients of insomnia or depression still eager to get access to such chemicals or health products more conveniently. In other words, a tryptophan-producing, domestic and portable device is a latent and potential trend for the patients to get rid of redundant steps in purchasing tryptophan and certainly, to treat insomnia and depression.

In our project, *E. coli* is adapted to construct a brand new strain whose regular proliferation and tryptophan biosynthesis are separated and controlled through a bistable control system, i.e. toggle switch, without affecting the viability of the cells. If possible, we hope to build the device to produce and purify the tryptophan based on our edited strain.
 
In our toggle switch, faster cell proliferation is expected to be witnessed under the induction of IPTG, while paused proliferation and elevated tryptophan yield would be observed after a growing temperature shift to over 42℃. As for the circuit, critical genes for either *E. coli* proliferation or tryptophan synthesis are retrieved and picked on the basis of previously published research. Ultimately, pykA(for proliferation) and *aroG*&amp;*trpAB*(for trp synthesis) were chosen to composite the toggle switch together with other necessary cis-acting elements. *pykA* encodes pyruvate kinase A in *E. coli*, which catalyzes the formation of pyruvate in the last step of glycolysis. Thus, the overexpression of pykA via exogenous plasmids is expected to result in an increase of pyruvate utilized by TCA cycle to produce additional NADH and ATP to support cell growth and division. However, glycolysis branches off at phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) because AroG catalyzes the formation of DAHP from PEP, and eventually tryptophan is synthesized due to a set of successive enzymes including trpAB. Hence, overexpression of aroG and trpAB elevates the tryptophan yield level but on the other hand affects the cell proliferation.

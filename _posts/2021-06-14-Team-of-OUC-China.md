### An Environment Project

由于抗生素的大规模使用，其造成的环境污染和食品残留问题对生态环境与健康安全已造成了威胁，故本项目以四环素类和大环内酯类抗生素为例，设计了高性能的全细胞生物传感器用以检测抗生素。为克服全细胞生物传感器常见的各种限制，本项目将一种荧光激活RNA适配体作为输出信号以增加传感器响应速度，并希望通过由CRISPRi和链置换反应组成的NIMPLY逻辑门基因线路提高传感器的信噪比 (signal-noise ratio) 和动态范围。

Due to the large-scale use of antibiotics, environmental pollution and food residues have posed a great threat to the ecological environment as well as human health. Therefore, this project aims to design a series of high-performance whole cell biosensors (WCBs) to detect antibiotics. To overcome the common limits of WCBs, a fluorescence-activated RNA aptamer is used as the output signal to increase the response speed, and it is hoped that the signal-noise ratio and dynamic range of the sensor can be improved by the NIMPLY logic gate gene circuit composed of CRISPRi and strand replacement reactions.

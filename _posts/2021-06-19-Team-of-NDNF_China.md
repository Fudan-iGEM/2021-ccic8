### A High-School Open Project

The potential of engineered organisms is currently restricted due to concerns related their risks and hazards, as well as lack of effective tracking after an escape and appropriate platforms for them to function beyond laboratory conditions. To address the above setbacks, we have designed Hidro: hydrogel systems that enable engineered bacterial strains to carry out their “programmed” tasks safely and at high efficiency.

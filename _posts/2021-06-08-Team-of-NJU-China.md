Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease estimated to affect more than 339 million people worldwide. People suffering from asthma can only use different levels of ICS or ICS-LABA to prevent exacerbations and control symptoms. We focus on type 2 inflammation in bronchus, which is common but a key contributor to asthma. Our scheme is to take advantage of RNAi therapy to target TSLP and GATA3 to degrade their expression of mRNA and consequently improve asthma situations. During this process, we use a self-assembled siRNA delivery system where we enclose the siRNAs with exosomes to inhibit the above genes' translation and to subsequently prevent downstream toxicity and immunogenicity, which is superior to the otherwise exogenously pre-assembled systems. Meanwhile, we connected with our community through human practices to raise awareness of asthma. To ensure our sustainable impact, we held a regional meetup and founded an organization called the Nanjing iGEM Association (NIA).

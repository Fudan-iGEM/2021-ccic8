### A New Application Project

Our project aims to design a new, harmless mosquito-killing device. The device produces l-lactic acid, acetic acid, ammonia to attract mosquitoes, and combines with high voltage electric net to achieve the purpose of trapping and killing mosquitoes. We also perform quorum sensing and acid response dynamic regulation to control key genes and use a suicide switch to prevent the leakage of bacteria.

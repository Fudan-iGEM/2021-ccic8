### A Fantastic Project

Ginsenosides, as active components of ginseng, have many pharmacological activities. Among them, ginsenoside CK has been widely studied for its excellent biological activities such as treating diabetes, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and anti-aging. However, CK almost does not exist in natural ginseng and can be produced by ginsenoside Rb1 through enzymatic conversion. In order to improve CK production, this project expressed β -glucoside enzyme derived from sulphurite leaf vulcanization bacteria in Pichia pastoris GS115 and applied it to deglycosylation of Rb1 and production of CK.

In this project, the SS-bgly gene derived from Sulfolobus solfataricus will be highly expressed in pichia coli system after codon optimization, and the enzymatic reaction conditions for the transformation of ginsenoside substrate Rb1 to CK from SS-bgly will be explored. Under the optimized enzymatic reaction conditions, the recombinant SS-bgly can transform ginsenoside Rb1 with higher substrate concentration into CK, which is conducive to the large-scale production of CK.

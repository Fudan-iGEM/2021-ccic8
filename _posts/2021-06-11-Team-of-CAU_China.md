### An Environment Project

Saline-alkali soil is unfavorable to crop growth. γ-polyglutamic acid, aka γ-PGA, is formed by glutamic acid. CAU_China hopes to treat the saline-alkali land through γ-PGA by soil bacteria Corynebacterium glutamicum using synthetic biology. We transfer the related genes from Bucillus subtilis into C.glutamicum to make it use glutamate to produce γ-PGA. We apply a composite kill-switch to kill our bacteria when both the ionic strength and pH of the soil decrease to an expected level.

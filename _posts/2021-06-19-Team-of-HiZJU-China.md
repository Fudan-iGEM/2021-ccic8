### An Environment Project

17 α-ethynyl estradiol (EE2) is an artificial estrogen with a strong estrogenic effect. 

The main component of contraceptives, EE2, will cause some serious diseases after intake. Because of no effective degradation method, estrogens are still accumulating in the environment. Therefore, HI-ZJU team decided to solve EE2 pollution problem. We obtained two target genes, amoA and hao, which can degrade EE2 by the way of co-metabolism, from ammonia oxidizing bacteria. Using these genes, we are able to create bacteria that can degrade EE2 by gene editing. Meanwhile, hold a pragmatic standpoint of our wastewater treatment practice (WWTP), we managed to making acquaintance with the local authority in charge of waste water recycling. Staff there introduce us to develop a treatment with high-sensibility of detecting the soluble 17 α-ethynyl estradiol in natural condition, whose percentage composition present to be relevantly low in order of magnitudes. Taking low level of EE2‘s background concentration in consideration, we managed to develop an effective and synthetic biological cascade amplification reaction superior to its rudimental form, which is competent to capture the EE2 via hydrophobic interaction between amino acid residue. We employ the artificial intelligence, a series of programs modified to bring upon hybrid on mutant site and calculate the combining Gibbs Free energy to sort out the best choice. In addition we attach a visible measurement he Green fluorescent protein (GFP), to the expression sequence of plasmid, which can linear indicates the content of EE2 in waste water.

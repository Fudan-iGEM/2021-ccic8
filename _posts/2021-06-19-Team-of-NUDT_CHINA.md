### A Foundational Advance Project

Optogenetic tools provide essential approaches to control designer cell function. Our project intends to optimize Predator Pro, a modularized protein degradation system we’ve been working on in the past few years, to achieve light-mediated degradation of endogenous cyclin D1, a key regulator protein in cell cycle, thereby manipulating cell cycle in mammalian cells. Integrating with a raspberry pie-based blue light illumination device, our system enables convenient control of cell cycle synchronization and remote spatiotemporal control of cell division. Our work may provide novel tools for fundamental research and therapeutic purposes, including dealing with complex diseases like superficial cancer, melanoma, psoriasis or chronic skin wounds, which are all caused by cell abnormal division.

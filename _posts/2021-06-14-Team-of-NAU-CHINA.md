Some places are heavily polluted by selenium-oxide ions, while some places lack selenium and even suffer from it, especially in China. Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) are a kind of elemental selenium wrapped in biological macromolecules such as proteins. Compared with other forms of selenium, it has the advantages of low toxicity, high efficiency, smaller particle size and higher activity, and has been widely used in medicine, agriculture, animal husbandry and other aspects. Some microorganisms have the nutural ability to reduce selenium-oxide anions to SeNPs. However, they are not always perfect. There are problems such as low reduction efficiency and low activity due to large particle size of SeNPs. We chose *E. coli* MG1655, which has the natural ability of reducing selenium oxide anions to SeNPs, as the chassis, added Csr F enzyme and Sef  A protein which could improve the reduction rate. Finally, a high-efficient selenium recovery bioreactor with higher reduction rate and higher product activity was obtained. The SeNPs produced in the bioreactor has been used to inhibit drug-resistant bacteria, adsorb heavy metal ions and improve the quality of crops with satisfactory results.

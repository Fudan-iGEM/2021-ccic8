### A Diagnostics Project

In 2010, acne was the eighth epidemic, accounting for 9.38% of the global population. From 2006 to 2016, the global prevalence of acne increased by 5.1%. The human body's innate immunity and inflammation of P. acnes is the key to acne pathology and sequelae. Therefore, we designed an engineered bacteria that can bind to the base of the mask express two fusion proteins under infrared-induced condition. The two fusion proteins can be aggregated into nanospheres to achieve killing and blocking of *Propionibacterium acnes*. Inflammation can achieve the purpose of curing acne and repairing the skin. We have successfully expressed our proteins and achieved temperature-controlled self-aggregation *in vitro*.

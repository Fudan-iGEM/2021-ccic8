### A Therapeutics Project

Infection remains the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in burn patients. *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is among the leading causes of nosocomial infection primarily because it is intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics and antimicrobials.

This year our team is working on *P. aeruginosa* infection and wound repair in burn treatment. Using principles of synthetic biology, we genetically modified *Gluconacetobacter xylinus* ATCC53582 to kill *P. aeruginosa* specifically through the production and release of chimeric bacteriocin SE protein and the immune protein. Moreover, the production of cellulose in the engineered *Gluconacetobacter xylinus* ATCC53582 was regulated by blue light，which can further prevent infection of other bacteria and promote wound repair.

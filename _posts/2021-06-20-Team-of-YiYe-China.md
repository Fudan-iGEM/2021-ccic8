Our goal is to detect cancer polyps through DNA methylation, along with a toehold switch. We aim to detect TFPI-2 and SDC2 in the stool sample because people with CRC have a distinct degree of these DNAs from healthy people. By doing DNA bisulfite conversion and PCR amplification of the methylated DNA, we can compare them with a standard DNAsample to see if it is positive or negative. Finally, by linking to a toehold switch that has a TaqMan on its tail, we can see the DNA glow if it has been methylated, which signifies the possibility of cancer polyps.

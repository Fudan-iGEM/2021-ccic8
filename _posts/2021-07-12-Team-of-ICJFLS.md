### A High-School Manufacturing Project

The ban on disposable plastics was fully implemented from January 2021 in China. Therefore, the industry of milky tea uses lot of paper straws to replace plastic straws, but it has many drawbacks, such as easy to break, short life span, or bad sense of experience. In our project, we want to use amylose to produce disposable straws. At present, it is difficult to extract amylose from plant starch, so we will clone the enzymes which are involved in amylose synthesis into plasmid, and introduce it into *E. coli*. Thus it can synthesize amylose for the manufacture of new straws.

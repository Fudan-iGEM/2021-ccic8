Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disability. According to American CDC, prevalence of autism in the U.S. has increased from 1 in 68 births in 2010 to 1 in 54 births in 2020. Although autism is a biological disorder, it is primarily treated through education and behavioral services, with medication as an important adjunct. However, to date, there is no effective drug to treat ASD. Apart from genetic factors, the protentially dangerous environmental factors to the maternal generation, such as Maternal immune activation(MIA) and Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), can also be the cause of ASD. According to the gut-brain axis theory, whether it is maternal immune activation or genetic factors, the etiologies of autism are all related to the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome interacts intimately with the intestins. And CNS deseases such as ASD or stroke can modify the composition of the gut microbiome, leading to a vicious cycle where gut dysbiosis exacerbates the neuroimmune response and aggravates brain pathology and behavior.

Aiming at using synthetic biology to prevent and treat autism through gut-brain axis, our experimental designed involves two parts: prevention in the maternal generation and treatment in the fetal generation. Epidemiological studies suggest that, in humans, fetus’ exposure to maternal inflammation increases the likelihood of autism spectrum disorder. When the immune system of a will-be-mother is activated due to infections or autoinflammatory syndromes, the Th17 and Treg cells in her bowel will lose their balance and inflammatory factors, such as IL-17, can then be transferred across the placental barrier to harm the nervous system of the fetus. In this case, her child will have an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. So we decided to develop a probiotic strain of *E. coli* as a novel, self-tuning “drug” for pregnant women to reudce the risk of autism in the offspring. As for treatment in the fetal generation, we attempted to code secretable oxytocin, which can be transported to the central nervous system through the gut-brain axis. 

Children with ASDs are also what we call ‘Children From the Star’. They are stars twinkling in the distant sky, all waiting for their time to drop on the earth but happening to be trapped in a bottle. And when the trapped one falls into a human’s bosom, the lady becomes his or her dear mother. When they grow up, they find it hard to make friends with other ‘normal’ kids. So the little one stays in his or her own planet, with nobody having ever landed on their planets and certain about what their planets are like. Our project aims at building up a stairway to the starlight, using engineering probiotics to prevent autism caused by maternal infection during pregnancy and treat children, thus structuring a way to health for the ‘Children From the Star’.
